# corgisim
A simulation suite for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Coronagraphic Instrument

## Installation Instruction

### Install Proper
Proper is an optical propagation library that is needed for CGISim to function
Go to the [Proper website](https://sourceforge.net/projects/proper-library/) and download proper_v3.3.3_python.zip
Unzip it in your working directory
Enter the directory that contains setup.py and run the following: 
```
python -m pip install .
```
### Install roman_preflight_proper and CGISIm
In your working directory, first clone [roman_preflight_proper](https://github.com/roman-corgi/cgisim_cpp)(
please note that this is not the official version, but a modified version needed to implement certain functions):
```
git clone https://github.com/roman-corgi/cgisim_cpp.git
```
Go to the [CGISim website](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cgisim/) and download cgisim_v4.0.zip
Unzip it in your working directory. For each of them, enter the directory that contains setup.py and run the following: 
```
python -m pip install .
```

### Install corgisim

Clone this directory:  

```
git clone https://github.com/roman-corgi/corgisim.git
```

Enter the directory that contains setup.py and run the following:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
``` 
pip install -e .
```
### Check you installation

Go to corgisim/test/ and run 
```
python test_installation.py
```

### Troubleshooting
If you get the following error:
```
ImportError: Unable to run roman_preflight prescription. Stopping.
```
it means that the program cannot locate roman_preflight_compact.py and/or roman_preflight.py. The error is described in page two of roman_preflight_proper_public_v2.0.pdf.
roman_preflight_compact.py and roman_preflight.py need to be copied in the same directory as the script you are trying to run (i.e. /corgisim/test/ if you are trying to run a test, corgisim/examples/if you are trying to run an example)

### Documentation
The automatic documentation is available at https://corgisim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

### Test
test_minimal.py runs on every pull request and push to main. Make sure that this test passes before you request a review. 

Put your 'nominal' case here. The goal is to ensure that developers don't break any existing functionality by mistake. If possible, insert your test in an existing test and only simulate images if necessary. 

Longer tests and unit tests should be in another file. All other tests run on push to main (which includes when a branch is merged) and once a week.
